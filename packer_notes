# Packer Notes

## Packer troubleshooting on Amazon

If packer fails to build an instance, and it destorys it at the end in order to troubleshoot that connection to that instance is needed
In order to do that add this to packer JSON file:
"ssh_keypair_name": "<name_of_keypair>",
"ssh_private_key_file": "<path_to_corresponding_private_key>"

packer needs to be ran with the following command:
packer build -on-error=abort ...
