CMP improvments on AWS

RDS - set production for multi-AZ
	- set event subscriptions for monitoring
	- free storage space alarm
	- maybe MySql alternative???
IAM - set roles for users
	- add martin for MFA
	- organize users in OUs # read somwhere, can't find it now :(
	- Create CrossAccount access
CloudWatch 	- adjust repeting periods for alarms
			- set warrnings
			- create billing alarms
			- instance state alarams
S3  - archiving
    - cross region replication
VPC - NACL # deny everything appart from http from all other addresses, allow all to devtech and UKDC IP
	- delete extra SGs
	- cross account access 
	- public and private subnet
		only webserver in public
		all other servers in private
EC2 - reserved instances
	- implemet ELB and AutoScaling
		autoscaling for webserver - min one, max one with script to create AMI during each deploy
		every service to be behind a loadbalancer and an autoscaling group - desired state 1 for the begginnig but that could change in the future
	- using spot instances as workers for cost saving # probably not a good idea
	- security groups when creating workers - use one and don''t create new ones each time
	- Mongo on Linux machine
	- if .netCore is used all apart from the webserver can be on Linux
    - use more tags, environment, role...
    - alternative - use microservices and containerize everything	
Route 53 - Endpoint health check for Webserver
		 - two hosted zones, one internal and one external
		 - every loadbalancer or ip to be sorted in hosted zones
SQS - Long Polling vs Short Polling
	- messages larger than 256 KB can be managed using the S3 or DynamoDB, with  SQS holding a pointer to the S3 object
	- use sequence numbers in messages
Resource Groups - Create tags and resource groups
possibly use a combination of terraform and some other tool (ansible, chef or puppet) for the whole infrastructure.
	those servers can be hosted in UKDC
CloudFormation
	1. create network diagram
	2. create appropriate SGs
	3. create template
		instances - function if Webserver - than t2.small
							 if WCF - than t2.micro...
		role needs to be added 
		'dependsOn' attribute for sg of mongo
